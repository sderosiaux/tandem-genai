# Tandem GenAI

Practice French with AI conversation partners who feel like real people.

## Why?

Learning a language from textbooks is boring. Apps like Duolingo teach you vocabulary, but they don't prepare you for real conversations with real people.

The best way to learn is to talk. But finding native speakers to practice with is hard, scheduling is a pain, and let's be honest — it can be intimidating.

**Tandem GenAI** gives you conversation partners available 24/7, each with their own personality, background, and quirks. They make mistakes (just like real learners), have opinions, tell jokes, and remember your past conversations.

## What is it?

A web app where you chat in French with AI personas who are "learning French" just like you might find on language exchange apps like Tandem or HelloTalk.

Each persona is a distinct character:

- **Jake** (USA) — A tech bro from Texas who makes terrible dad jokes and thinks American football is superior to soccer
- **Maria** (Brazil) — An enthusiastic art student who uses too many emojis and tells dramatic stories about her exes
- **Hans** (Germany) — A reserved engineer who quotes philosophers and has strong opinions about punctuality
- **Yuki** (Japan) — A shy UX designer who apologizes constantly and makes obscure anime references
- **James** (UK) — A posh investor who vouvoie everyone and drops passive-aggressive remarks
- **Sofia** (Italy) — A passionate chef who mixes Italian into her French and WRITES IN CAPS when excited

They're not perfect French speakers — they each have a different level and make realistic mistakes based on their native language (just like real learners do).

## Who is it for?

- French learners who want low-pressure conversation practice
- People preparing for trips to France or French-speaking countries
- Anyone who wants to practice without the anxiety of talking to strangers
- Language enthusiasts who enjoy chatting with interesting characters

## Features

- **6 unique personas** with distinct personalities, humor styles, and opinions
- **Realistic language errors** based on each persona's level and native language
- **Conversation memory** — they remember what you talked about before
- **Natural chat flow** — they can send multiple messages, change topics, disagree with you
- **No judgment** — practice as much as you want, make mistakes, try again
